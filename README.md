this is a project where we can search for a part-time job or a full-time employee and an employer can find the specific type of work
1'st after login, we will see 2 sections 1. work provider 2. employer. 
2'nd the user who needs a part-time job can press employer and another section will be selected by a person who needs a part-time worker or full-time employee.
if a user presses work provider he needs to enter some details for the job he needs to provide like where it is located and amount of the work per day.
and if a person needs part-time work he needs to press the employer button. it will open a new page about the work type like whether he needs to work in construction, industry, shops, etc..... 
after selecting the work type he needs to work there will be some part-time work and a brief explanation.
